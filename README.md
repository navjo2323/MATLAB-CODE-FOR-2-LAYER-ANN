# MATLAB-CODE-FOR-2-LAYER-ANN

The implementation is vectorised to perform faster.
Costfunction uses randomly initialised parameters for the two layers rolled in a single vector/array.


The sigmoid(x) function is used as the activation function which is given by 1/1+ exp(-x)
Sigmoidgradient(x) function calculates the derivative which is given as (sigmoid(x))(1-sigmoid(x))
